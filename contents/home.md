Miguel García-Duch holds a Ph.D. in Economics from Complutense University of Madrid (UCM), with
a thesis that delves into the macroeconomic imbalances in the eurozone and the associated 2011 debt
crisis. This research culminated in an award-winning publication in the Journal of World Economy in
2018. Possessing a strong foundation in political economy, macroeconomics, and advanced statistical
analysis, Miguel has showcased his expertise in econometric modelling and data analysis throughout
his five-year tenure at Real Energy Systems and in his role as a freelance data scientist. Beyond this,
his English proficiency, verified by a C1 IELTS certification, has enabled successful academic
collaborations, including his stint as a visiting researcher at Kingston University, London. He has held
teaching positions at both Universidad Complutense de Madrid and the University of Valladolid.
Currently associated with the Complutense Institute for International Studies (ICEI-UCM), Miguel is
deepening his exploration into income and wealth distribution trends, using extensive databases and
surveys. Alongside, his upcoming research is also centred on the Spanish economy and housing
accessibility. Passionate about research and academia, Miguel is actively seeking opportunities to
expand on these interests.
